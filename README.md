## What is it
Simple automation pipeline to build: 
1. LXD images for custom github actions runner whenever actions/runner creates a new release.
2. OCI images for a self-hosted github actions runner

## Building

Instructions for building both the LXD-based and self-hosted actions runners.

### LXD Image used by Actions Runner

Use these instructions to build the component required by the github-hosted actions runner.

#### Pre-reqs

1. lxd
  - Install lxd either via snap `snap install lxd --classic` or, under Ubuntu, as package in the repo
  - Initialize lxd via `lxd init` and answer the prompts according to your preferences. For example,
    create a file `lxd-preseed.yaml` containing:
    ```
    config: {}
    cluster: null
    networks:
    - config:
        ipv4.address: auto
        ipv6.address: auto
      description: "gaplib network"
      name: lxdbr0
      type: ""
    storage_pools:
    - config: {}
      description: "gaplib storage pool"
      name: default
      driver: dir
    profiles:
    - config: {}
      description: "gaplib"
      devices:
        eth0:
          name: eth0
          nictype: bridged
          parent: lxdbr0
          type: nic
        root:
          path: /
          pool: default
          type: disk
      name: default
    ```
    Run the command `lxd init --preseed <lxd-preseed.yaml`

#### Running Build

To build the github actions execute the `setup-build-env.sh` script

### OCI Image used as Self-Hosted Action Runner

A self-hosted runner is a system that you deploy and manage to execute jobs from GitHub Actions on GitHub.com.

See the github documentation on [self-hosted runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/about-self-hosted-runners).
In particular:
* [Adding a self-hosted runner](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/adding-self-hosted-runners)
* [Using self-hosted runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/using-self-hosted-runners-in-a-workflow)
* [Hardening your self-hosted runner](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/security-hardening-for-github-actions#hardening-for-self-hosted-runners)

#### Pre-reqs
1. docker or podman

#### Building Images

Run `./build-selfhosted.sh [-b <buildtool>] [distro ...]`

Where 
* `-b <buildtool>` defaults to whichever out of `podman` or `docker` it finds. You may override by specifying either of these tools.
* `[distro ...]` is either `ubunutu`, `almalinux`, or `opensuse`. If nothing specified then all are built

## Using

For both modes of running actions runners, there may be firewall changes required to allow github to communicate with the runner. For example, if the LXD-based system is listening on port 5000 then on a RHEL-like system:
```
firewall-cmd --add-port=5000/tcp
```
Similarly, if you have one or more self-hosted actions runners then each may be defined on github to connect on a different port which is then mapped by the OCI runtime to port 443. Each of those external ports need to firewall configuration.

### LXD-based

Documentation coming soon

### Self-Hosted

The OCI image is ephemeral and requires configuration each time it is used. To create an application-specific OCI image then you 
use the image created earlier and pre-configure it so each time it is started it is ready to perform the actions for the specific repository. 

#### Configuring

Assume we wish to provide actions for the pleia2/python-test repository. We would create a image using the following dockerfile where the TOKEN argument 
is generated when you add the self-hosted runner on github. ![Generating Token](selfhostedrunner.png)

Sample file `Dockerfile.test`

```
FROM    localhost/runner:ubunutu

ARG     REPO TOKEN

RUN     /opt/runner/config.sh --url ${REPO} --token ${TOKEN}

CMD     /opt/runner/run.sh
```

To build:
* __Docker__: `docker build --build-arg=TOKEN=xxxxxx --build-arg=REPO=yyyyy --squash -f Dockerfile.test --tag runner:test .`
* __Podman__: `podman build --build-arg=TOKEN=xxxxx --build-arg=REPO=yyyyy  --squash-all -f Dockerfile.test --tag runner:test --from localhost/runner:ubuntu .`

##### Sample Build

```
> podman build -f Dockerfile.test --build-arg TOKEN=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX --build-arg REPO=https://github.com/nealef/xx-xxxx --tag runner:test --from localhost/runner:ubuntu --squash-all .
STEP 1/4: FROM localhost/runner:ubuntu
STEP 2/4: ARG     REPO TOKEN
STEP 3/4: RUN     /opt/runner/config.sh --url ${REPO} --token ${TOKEN}
